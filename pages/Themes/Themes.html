        <h1>Themes</h1>
        <p>Themes are a common component of modern web browsing.</p>
        <p>Having different colour options often improves the users experience when browsing and reading text as they can choose the theme with the most comfort for them.</p>
        <p>Perhaps saving the selected theme would be useful to further improve UX... I'll leave that one to you &colon;&rbrack; <a class="link-glow" href="../Storage/Storage.html">Hint</a></p>
        <label for="ThemeSelect">Choose a theme</label>
        <select name="ThemeSelect" id="ThemeSelect" autocomplete="off">
            <option value="dark">Dark</option>
            <option value="purple">Purple</option>
        </select>
        <p class="dark-hidden">
            This text was hidden by the dark theme. It's important when using themes that it is done properly using CSS variables.<br>
            CSS Variables will allow you to set values in the <code>:root</code> which can then be referenced later using <code>var(--variable-name)</code>.<br>
            &ast; I didn't actually do this here, instead I cheated. However the method of changing the theme is still the same in the <a class="link-glow" href="Themes.js">JavaScript</a>.<br>
            &ast;&ast; This theme also has really poor contrast so would be a bad idea unless the colour of the text was also changed, this is what CSS variables can be used for!
